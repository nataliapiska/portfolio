# Hello, I'm Natalia Piska 🙋‍♀️

### ABOUT ME:
👋 Hi! I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Software Tester with a strong foundation in manual and mobile testing. My journey in the world of quality assurance has been shaped by a deep curiosity for technology.

### WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE:
🔍 ## Manual and Mobile Testing: I have a talent for finding bugs through meticulous manual testing. Whether web applications or mobile apps, I identify issues before they reach the end-users.

💻 Web Technologies: My expertise extends to web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This knowledge enables me to understand the underlying structure of web applications, identify UI/UX issues, and collaborate effectively with developers to resolve them.

🗃️ SQL: enabling me to interact effectively with databases, retrieve data for testing purposes, and ensure data integrity in software applications.

🤖 Cypress: I have hands-on experience with Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework, which allows me to create comprehensive automated tests that ensure the functionality and stability of web applications.

### WHY I LOVE WHAT I DO:
🌟 Quality assurance isn't just a job for me; it's a passion. I thrive on the challenge of continuous improvement, keeping up with industry trends, and embracing new testing methodologies.
